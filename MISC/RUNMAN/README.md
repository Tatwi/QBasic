## RUNMAN

Testing sprite animation using a 4 frame 8x8 running man.  Created within my COMMON.BAS framework circa 2020.07.08. I made the sprites in my CVSMAKER.BAS program and it appears they are mirrored and rotated 90 degrees left when used.  

I wanted to figure out how to make it look like he was running smoothly and how to play the idle (standing) animation when he wasn't running. Understanding these basics will help me develop a system that can animate multiple sprites at a time.
