## Common Directory

This is the Screen Mode 7 framework I am creating as the basis for my text mode games. It's designed to enhance the chunky 40x25 ASCII characters using 16 color sprites that are loaded from pain text CSV files. It's essentially a collection of subroutines and demonstrations of how they are used.


**COMMON.BAS**  
This is the main file.   When I am ready to use it in a game, I'll copy the file and modify it to be the new game.


**NAME.CSV Files**  
These are 16 color sprites in comma separated value format.
