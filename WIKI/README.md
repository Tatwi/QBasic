## My QBasic 1.1 Wiki

This directory contains general information about QBasic as well as more detailed information about my own projects that I thought it would be helpful to share. Below you will find a short description of each file and directory within the wiki.  

[**Reference_Material.md**](Reference_Material.md)  
A list of physical books and online resources. Fair warning, I haven't read all the books, but I have read that these are the most useful and well written on the subject.  

[Text-ASCII_Info.md](Text-ASCII_Info.md)  
I prefer using QBasic to make "retro" text graphics style programs with QBasic, as though it's a super version of the Commodore PET I suppose. This file has some information about using ASCII characters, screen modes, and colors.
