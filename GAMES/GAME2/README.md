## How to Play

When you first begin the game you must set your character attributes, such as your personality type, your adventuring class, and strengths and weakness. Once that has been completed, you are sent directly into the "Relax at home with your family" activity, which is akin to resting in other games. From there you can choose to do other things by pressing any of the function keys. You don't technically need to do anything to pass the time, as the game will update events as time goes by (only while the game is running), but the activities are there for your entertainment.  

In order to sell items in your store, you will need to craft items in your shop. Each item you craft requires materials. You start off with a basic set of tools in your shop, an inventory of various materials, and 1000 coins in purse. When starting the game, it would be wise to craft some basic weapons, tools, or armor and put them up for sale in your shop. Should you need certain materials, you will likely find them at the local market. Anything material you can't find locally you will have to post a bounty for on the job board or hope that you come across in your personal adventures.  

When you start the game your shop is automatically outfitted with a general helper. Your helper has attributes that determine their effectiveness at various tasks and assignments. When you only have one employee, they will be responsible for all three jobs at the business, however you may hire two more employees so that all roles are filled by a specialist. The roles are smithy assistant, customer service, and shop maintenance. Each person will be suited to different roles, but anyone can be trained to the best of their abilities.  

Overall, your goal is to supply your community with the best and most affordable gear possible, while sustaining your business and lifestyle. That doesn't mean everyone will want to buy plate armor and magical swords all the time, because different people have different needs. While it's totally fine to specialize in one type of gear, you will sell items more frequently if you have a larger variety of items available for purchase.

The game is basically over when you run out of money. That means you have nothing left to sell and your personal gear is so poor that no one will hire you to join their adventuring party. Not ending up destitute is definitely avoidable through thoughtful management of your resources, so take care not to let that happen. That said, you can choose to retire at any time and start a new game. When you retire a summary of your life will be saved in the annuls of time, which can be viewed by running the HISTORY.BAS program.
