# Player Gear Slots
Like many other games, the player's attributes are provided by the gear that they are wearing. This is primarily a crafting game, where the player is mostly concerned with creating items that others would be interested in buying, but the player also has their own adventuring gear load out should they choose to embark upon an adventure themselves. This load out is a template of what every other adventurer also has and it is comprised of the following item slots:  

- Head
- Shoulders
- Chest
- Legs
- Feet
- Wrists
- Hands
- Cape
- Weapon/Tool
- Shield
- Accessory 1
- Accessory 2

The player is able to craft items for all slots, with the exception of the two accessory slots which must be purchased from other shops. Accessories are wildcards that allow the player to hone or augment their stats to their liking.  

All items have the possibility of being imbued by magic, which then grants the user some kind of magical ability or benefit.  

The monetary value of items is based upon its stat values, its magical abilities, and its intended use. Generally, lower Encumbrance + higher Health/Mana/Damage/Armor/Precision + Magical Effect + Damage Resistance = higher value.  


# Shop Tools
The player's shop always has a set of tools which can be upgraded. The following are the upgrade slots available:

- Artisan Hammer
- Chisel and Punch Set
- Tongs
- Anvil
- Vice
- Forge

Tools with higher stats will create items that have higher monetary value. Only stats provided by shop tools and gear slot accessories are factored into the crafting process.
