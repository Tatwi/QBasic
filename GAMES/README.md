# My QBasic Games

I'm focusing on using Screen 0 and Screen 7 to create character graphic and small sprite games for 386 computers, using only the capabilities of the Microsoft QBasic 1.1 IDE.

**GAME1:**  
Collect all the hearts and escape the caves before the tunnels collapse and you run out of bombs.
