# My QBasic Games

These are the games I have made for DOSBox and 386 computers, using only the Microsoft QBasic 1.1 IDE.  

To play the games, download or clone this repository, install and configure DOSBox per the instructions in the main README file, run DOSBox and type ...  

cd games\game1  
qbasic /run game  


## GAME1:
*Status: Complete*  

An ASCII game where the player collect all the hearts before the tunnels collapse or they run out of bombs.  


## GAME2: Ye Olde Smithy
*Status: In Development*  

An ASCII art game crafting game where the player is a blacksmith in a randomly generated world full of magic, wonder, and danger. Sell your wares to townsfolk and adventurers. Buy and sell resources. Hire staff. Learn about and interact with your community.  

Up to five different player profiles can be created, each with its own unique world of people, resources, towns, markets, and dangers. Will you choose a war torn world fraught with dark magic and evil happens or is your world a more serene place?  

The crafting system is inspired by other games I have played, such as Star Wars Galaxies, Everquest II, and Guild Wars 2. Choose the resources, tools, skills, and assistants that will allow you to create the best possible item for your desired purpose. Enjoy an interactive multi-stage process that employs the player's decision making skills rather than relies on randomness. Remember, each customer has their own needs and desires!  

This is a very complex game that makes use of many text files to store far more data than what can be loaded into RAM by QBasic. This data is used to simulate the activity of a living world, from the perspective of the Smithy, such that there should be many hours of game play to enjoy.
